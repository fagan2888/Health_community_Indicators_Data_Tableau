<h3>Intro about Data </h3> :
Data Analysis on HCI attributes which determines the standard of livinghis table contains data on the percent of population
age 25 and up with a four-year college degree or higher for California, its regions, counties, county subdivisions, cities,
towns, and census tracts. Greater educational attainment hasbeen associated with health-promoting behaviors including consumption of fruits and vegetables and other aspects of healthy eating, 
engaging in regular physical activity, and refraining from excessive consumption of alcohol and from smoking. Completion of formal 
education (e.g., high school) is a key pathway to employment and access to healthier and higher paying jobs that can provide food, housing, transportation, health insurance, and other basic necessities for a healthy life. Education is linked with social and psychological factors, including sense of control, social standing and social support. These factors can improve health through reducing stress, influencing health-related behaviors and providing practical and emotional support. More information on the data table and a data dictionary can be found in the Data and Resources section. The educational attainment table is part of a series of indicators in the Healthy Communities Data and Indicators Project (HCI) of the Office of Health Equity. The goal of HCI is to enhance public health by providing data, a standardized set of statistical measures, and tools that a broad array of sectors can use for planning healthy communities and evaluating the impact of plans, projects, policy, and environmental changes on community health. The creation of healthy social, economic, and physical environments that promote healthy behaviors and healthy outcomes requires coordination and collaboration across multiple sectors, including transportation, housing, education, agriculture and others. Statistical metrics, or indicators, are needed to help local, regional, and state public health and partner agencies assess 
community environments and plan for healthy communities that optimize public health.
